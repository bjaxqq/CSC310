# CSC310

## Course Description

Students are introduced to operating systems and the software to support these systems. Topics include operating system principles, concurrency, scheduling and dispatch, virtual memory, device management, security and protection, file systems and naming, and real-time systems.

## Tools Used

For this course we were taught how to use the C programming language for operating system programming, as well as how to use XUbuntu in VirtualBox/UTM for testing our code with `make` and `Valgrind`. I had previous experience with Linux and already had everything set up so I worked on my home desktop (and SSH'd in if in the classroom).
